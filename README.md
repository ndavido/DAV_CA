# European Cities Airbnb Pricing Index

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Airbnb Pricing Index in European citiesâ€”a project designed to measure, analyze, and visualize the competitiveness and attractiveness of Airbnb listings across Europe. This index is part of the BSc (Honours) in Computing in Software Development coursework, focusing on Data Analysis and Visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed information on Airbnb listings in various European cities. It includes a multitude of variables such as listing prices, locations, reviews, and more. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities).

## Indicators

The composite indicator developed in this project will integrate multiple variables from the dataset to provide a single, comprehensive measure. The indicators include:

- **Price competitiveness**: Reflecting how prices compare among cities, considering the local economic context.
- **Location attractiveness**: Assessing the desirability of the listing locations within each city.
- **Customer satisfaction**: Based on reviews and ratings, gauging the quality of guest experiences.
- **Amenity quality**: Evaluating the range and quality of amenities offered in each listing.

Each indicator contributes to a nuanced understanding of the Airbnb market, and their aggregation into a composite index offers a unique perspective on city-level competitiveness within the European Airbnb landscape.
